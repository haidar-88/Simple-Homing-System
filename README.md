This Python code simulates the interception of a missile in a 3D space, allowing both the space dimensions (in kilometers) 
and the speeds of the missile and interceptor (in meters per second) to be dynamically adjusted before running the program.

Code Breakdown and Logic:
1)Imports and Setup:
- The necessary libraries are imported, including matplotlib for 3D plotting, numpy for efficient numerical operations, and datetime and time to handle time-based functions.
- The simulation is set up to run in a 3D space with default units in kilometers (km), and time is updated at regular intervals.

2)check_if_hit(missile, target, threshold=0.1):
- This function calculates the Euclidean distance between the missile and the target.
- It prints the current distance to the target and checks if this distance is within a given threshold (0.1 km by default). If the distance is less than or equal to the threshold
it returns True, indicating the missile has hit the target.

3)update_missile_loc(missile, target, speed, time_per_move):
- The missile's position is updated over time, moving it toward the target. The direction vector from the missile to the target is calculated.
- The missile moves in this direction with a specified speed. The magnitude of movement per step is calculated as speed * time_per_move, which ensures that the missile moves at a realistic rate.
- If the missile reaches or surpasses the target, its coordinates are set to the target’s position.

4)update_interceptor_loc(intercept, missile, intercept_speed, time_per_move):
- This function operates similarly to update_missile_loc but instead moves the interceptor toward the missile. The direction and movement calculations are the same
but the interceptor’s target is the missile rather than the final target.

5)check_if_intercepted(intercept, missile, threshold=0.1):
- Like check_if_hit, this function calculates the distance between the interceptor and the missile. If this distance is less than or equal to the threshold
it indicates that the interceptor successfully intercepted the missile.

Main Simulation Logic:
The main loop continuously updates the missile’s and interceptor’s positions at every time step (time_per_move). After every position update, the following checks are made:
- If the missile has hit the target.
- If the interceptor has intercepted the missile.
- If either of these conditions is met, the loop terminates. Otherwise, it continues to update and plot the missile's and interceptor's paths.

Dynamic Parameters:
- 3D Space: The space is defined in kilometers, and the coordinates of the missile, interceptor, and target can be dynamically adjusted before the program starts running. 
For example, the missile is initially at [0.0, 4000.0, 8000.0] km, but these values can be changed.
- Speed: Both the missile and interceptor speeds are adjustable and set in meters per second (m/s). The default values are 800 m/s for the missile and 650 m/s for the interceptor. 
These can also be customized before the program runs.

Visualization:
The missile, interceptor, and target are visualized in a 3D space using matplotlib. A dynamic plot is updated at each time step, displaying:
- Red Path: The missile’s trajectory as it moves toward the target.
- Blue Path: The interceptor’s trajectory as it moves to intercept the missile.
- Green Marker: The target’s fixed position.
The 3D plot's axes are labeled X, Y, and Z, all representing distances in kilometers. The missile’s and interceptor’s paths are shown over time
and each iteration of the loop generates a new plot showing their current positions.

Final Visualization:
At the end of the simulation, whether successful or failed, a final 3D plot is displayed showing the entire paths taken by both the missile and the interceptor
as well as the location of the target. This gives a complete visual summary of the simulation.

Code Logic Focus:
The main logic of this code revolves around calculating directions and distances between the missile, interceptor, and target, updating their positions accordingly, and continuously 
checking for conditions like interception or target hit. The focus is on simulating realistic motion in 3D space with dynamic speed and position updates. 
The code efficiently calculates the necessary movements, checks conditions, and updates visualizations in real time.

In summary, the missile interception simulation provides a flexible and dynamic model where both the 3D space and the speeds of the missile and interceptor can be customized, allowing for various 
scenarios to be visualized and analyzed.
